### Assignment Issues
I first had issues with the lunch-generator.js file. I couldn't get it to randomize and display the lunch array. I also had trouble getting it to communicate with the index.js file. My second issue was getting images to display through Webpack. 

### Outside Sources
[freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/)
I used this site as a refresher on formatting the footer position.

[learnhowtoprogram.com](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/responsive-design-development-environments/images-with-webpack)
I used this source to help figure out how to get images to display using Webpack. I followed their instructions for configuring Webpack for images and was able to get it to work.
